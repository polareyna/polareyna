## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Paula Reyna.
But most people call me Pola!.
I'm a frontend developer with 5+ years of experience in developing and designing solutions. 
Currently working as the Tech Lead for the Assesments team at Magpie.
I love playing videogames, listening to music and chilling with my cats Teodora and Fanta (who is, as expected, an orange tabby)
